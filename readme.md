# Node.js project

# User Registration API

This project aims to provide a robust User Registration API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows users to register, authenticate, and perform various operations related to user management.

# Tools

1.  MongoDB Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store user information.
2.  Mongoose: Mongoose is an ODM tool that is providing a schema-based solution to model application data.
3.  Postman: Used for API testing
4.  Git & Github: Git version control system is employed for managing project changes, and Github serves as the remote repository for collaboration and version tracking.

# Project Setup

1. Navigate to the project directory: cd "path name"
2. Create a Node.js environment with a specific version using nodeenv.
3. Activate the environment.
4. Initialize npm in the project directory.
5. Initialize a git repository.
6. Install necessary packages using npm, including Express, nodemon, Mongoose, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, joi, bcrypt, nodemailer, and multer.

# Usage-

1. Express: Set up the Express server to handle HTTP requests and define API routes.
2. Mongoose Models: Define user schema and models using Mongoose for MongoDB interactions.
3. Middleware: Implement middleware for request validation, error handling, and authentication.
4. JSON Web Tokens: Utilize JSON Web Tokens for user authentication and authorization.
5. Password Hashing: Securely hash user passwords using bcrypt.
6. Email Sending: Implement email sending functionality for user registration and other notifications using Nodemailer.
7. File Uploads: Handle file uploads securely using Multer middleware.

# Getting Started

1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running.
2. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
3. Install dependencies: npm install
4. Set up environment variables using a .env file.
5. Start the server: npm start or nodemon server.js for development with automatic server restarts.
